# Pi-Alarm

Using a Raspberry Pi, I created a burglar alarm system which alerts the homeowner when there was an issue at their house. This connected was connected into the Twilio API with my Python program, which would send SMS messages through my account. This then came to the phone.

Then if there was motion there was a short delay for the user to disarm the alarm through a paired RF remote control. Which has three buttons, one for arming, one for disarming, and a red panic button, which would automatically sound the alarm.
